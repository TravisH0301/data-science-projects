# Data Exploration Project
## Commuting Distance to Work in Greater Melbourne
### Aim of the Project
This project aims to study the commuting behaviours of Australians particularily living in Greater Melbourne. <br>
Through exploration and visualisation, it focuses on the following questions to understand the relationships <br>
between the Australian workers' characteristics and the commuting distance. 

- How does one's work affect commuting distance?
- How does the method of travel relate to commuting distance?
- How does one's living arrangements correlate with commuting distance?

### Datasets
This projects uses the following datasets published in 2016. 

-	‘Commuting Distance by Personal Characteristics’ from Australian Bureau of Statistics – Census of Population and Housing 2016
-	‘Commuting Distance from Place of Usual Residence’ from Australian Bureau of Statistics – Census of Population and Housing 2016
-	‘Suburbs: Detailed information by suburb and segment of the community’ from Greater Dandenong – Statistical Data for Victorian Communities
-	‘Victoria Mesh Blocks ASGS Ed 2016 Digital Boundaries’ from Australian Bureau of Statistics – Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS)

### Pre-processing & Visualisation
The datasets are pre-processed using Python prior to the visualisation on Tableau and R Shiny.

### Interactive Visualisation
An interactive visualisation is built using R shiny and ggplot2.<br>
Narration is also added to provide information to the viewers.
