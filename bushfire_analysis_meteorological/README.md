# Bushfire Analysis using Meteorological Data
Bush fires are critical threats to nature and human lives causing enormous economical and ecological damages. 
In Australia, bush fires are serious environmental issues. In late 2019 and early 2020, Australia experienced 
devastating bush fires that burnt approximately 18.6 million hectares, destroying over 5000 houses and building 
and killing at least 34 people and around one billion animals (Calma, 2020). This has also caused significant 
environmental and ecological impacts as well as the Australian economy.

To prevent or mitigate such disasters, fast detection is important. This project aims to approach this problem by 
building regression models to predict the burned area using meteorological data. In building regression models, 
different models are to be compared and the best model will be selected. Additionally, a subset of attributes that 
have a strong correlation to the burned area is to be identified as well.

The models will be trained and tested using the data collected from the northeast region of Portugal that includes 
information related to fire occurrences, such as spatial location, date, the forest Fire Weather Index (FWI), weather
and the total burned area (Cortez & Morais, 2007).
